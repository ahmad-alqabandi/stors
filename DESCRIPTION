Description: Fast and efficient sampling from general univariate probability
    density functions. Implements a rejection sampling approach designed to take
    advantage of modern CPU caches and minimise evaluation of the the target
    density for most samples. Many standard densities are internally implemented
    in 'C' for high performance, with general user defined densities also
    supported.
