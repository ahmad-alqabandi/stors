\title{Delete Built-in Proposal}
\usage{
delete_build_in_proposal(sampling_function, proposal_type = "custom")
}
\arguments{
\item{sampling_function}{String. The name of the sampling distribution's function in STORS.
For example, \code{"srgamma"} or \code{"srchisq"}.}

\item{proposal_type}{String. Either \code{"custom"} to delete the custom proposal or \code{"scaled"} to delete the scaled proposal.
Defaults to \code{"custom"}.}
}
\value{
A message indicating the status of the deletion process, or an error if the operation fails.
}
\description{
This function deletes built-in proposals from disk by specifying the sampling function and proposal type.
It is useful for managing cached proposals and freeing up storage space.
}
\details{
The function looks for the specified proposal type associated with the sampling function in the built-in proposals directory.
If the proposal exists, it deletes the corresponding proposal file from disk and frees its cached resources.
If the specified sampling function or proposal type does not exist, an error is thrown.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Should not be run during check to avoid deleting built-in proposal grids,
# which would cause testthat tests to fail

# Delete a custom proposal for the srgamma function
delete_build_in_proposal(sampling_function = "srgamma", proposal_type = "custom")

# Delete a scaled proposal for the srnorm function
delete_build_in_proposal(sampling_function = "srnorm", proposal_type = "scaled")
}
